        <h2 class="sub-heading">What is Programming Languages</h2>
        <p class="post-text">A programming language is a set of rules and syntax used to write computer programs. It provides a way for humans to communicate instructions to computers effectively. Programming languages allow developers to define algorithms, create software applications, and control the behavior of computer systems. Each programming language has its own syntax and features, designed to handle specific tasks or solve particular problems. Popular programming languages include Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. These languages have varying levels of abstraction, performance, and application domains. Choosing the right programming language depends on factors such as the project requirements, ease of use, available libraries, and community support.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Example of the Programming Languages</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Python</th>
              <td>Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It has a large and active community, making it ideal for tasks such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and automation. Python's extensive libraries, such as NumPy and Pandas, provide powerful tools for scientific computing and data manipulation.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>Java</th>
              <td>Java is a widely-used, object-oriented programming language that emphasizes portability and platform independence. It is known for its robustness, scalability, and security features. Java is commonly used for building enterprise-level applications, Android app development, and web services. Its vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools, including Spring and Hibernate, make it a popular choice for large-scale projects.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>C++</th>
              <td>C++ is a powerful and efficient programming language widely used for system-level programming, game development, and high-performance applications. It offers low-level control over hardware resources and supports object-oriented and procedural programming paradigms. C++ excels in performance-critical scenarios and is often used to build software that requires direct memory management or hardware interaction.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>JavaScript</th>
              <td>JavaScript is a versatile scripting language primarily used for web development. It enables interactive and dynamic features on websites, handling client-side scripting and providing enhanced user experiences. JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js have gained popularity for building rich and responsive web applications. Additionally, JavaScript can now be used for server-side development with the introduction of Node.js.</td>
